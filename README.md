# vote-ui - Shipped Three-Tier Demo Application UI
![](screenshot.png)
This repository is part of a demonstration three-tier Shipped application (UI, API, and database).  It should be deployed together with its companion repository, [CiscoCloud/vote-api](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/vote-api) and the standard Shipped Postgres datapack.  

### Running the Three-Tier Demo on Your Laptop
1. Fork the two repositories, [CiscoCloud/vote-api](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/vote-api) and [CiscoCloud/vote-ui](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/vote-ui), into your own GitHub account (or into the account of an organization for which you have admin access).
2. In a browser (we recommend Chrome), navigate to the [Cisco Shipped UI](http://ciscoshipped.io/).  If necessary, press `Sign up with GitHub` to login.
3. If Shipped does not display a **Create Your Application** popup dialog, select "Create New Application" from the **Your Projects** dropdown in the upper right of the form.
4. Enter a suitable name for your application (for example, "demo-three-tier") and press `Start Composing`.
5. Shipped displays the **Compose Your Application** form open to the Develop tab.  Click on `Add an existing repository`, enter "vote-ui" in the `New repository name` field and press Enter.  Shipped adds the vote-ui service to yoru application.
6. If necessary, click on `Add an existing repository` again.  Then enter "vote-api" in the `New repository name` field and press Enter.  Shipped adds the vote-api service to yoru application.
7. Click on Datastores.  Look for the **Postgres** datastore and click on its Select button.  Shipped adds the Postgres datastore service to your application.
8. Click `Save Project`.  Shipped builds the project.
9. In order to bootstrap the project to your laptop, it's necessary for you to install the Shipped CLI.  The method for doing do depends on your OS:
   * Linux or Mac. Run command `curl https://api.ciscoshipped.io/cli/static/shipped-setup.sh | bash -s`
   * Windows.  Download and run [shipped-install.exe](https://bintray.com/shippedrepos/shipped-install/download_file?file_path=windows%2Fshipped-install.exe)
10. You will need an user token to identify yourself to the Shipped CLI.  To get one, click your name in the upper right corner of the Shipped UI, select `My Profile`, and then click on the large `Show My User Token` button.  Shipped reveals the token.
11. Change to the directory where you want Shipped to create local copies of your repos and issue the command: 

    shipped local boot *applicationName* -t *userToken*

    where *applicationName* is the name you gave your application in step 4, and *userToken* is the token copied and pasted from the Shipped UI in step 10.
12. The local boot command produces considerable output as it builds local repositories for your project's services and deploys them into a local VM, creating one if necessary.  It finishes with output similar to:
